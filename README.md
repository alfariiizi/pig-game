# Pig Game

This game is inspired from Jonas Schmedtmann's Pig Game that is also part of his amazing [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=DSA_Catchall_la.EN_cc.ID&utm_term=_._ag_112265177716_._ad_475719959752_._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-416504847274_._li_9072640_._pd__._&gclid=CjwKCAjwgb6IBhAREiwAgMYKRl4wqvNuqsw1GrAdeam8t9SpmV3SSHY4cucOKzI6rw1yrmJ_JTw9XRoChOYQAvD_BwE) course.

I just watched the overview section, and then I do myself for the rest. So, maybe the code is completly different from what Jonas did in the final.
